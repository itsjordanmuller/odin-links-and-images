# Odin Links and Images

This repository, titled "Odin Links and Images," demonstrates the basic use of HTML for creating web pages with hyperlinks and images. The structure comprises a homepage (index.html) and an about page (about.html), showcasing how to link between different pages and external sites, as well as how to embed images, in this case: an image of a dog.

This repository is part of a series dedicated to [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum. I used the Odin Project as a way to practice various concepts of development and programming. The Odin Project is actually why I started using [Git](https://git-scm.com/) & [GitHub](https://github.com/itsjordanmuller) in the first place!
